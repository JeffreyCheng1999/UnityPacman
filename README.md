# UnityPacman

Description:
-
Hello everyone! this is my university game development module project by using Unity to create a 2D Pacman. 

1 - The PacMan folder is the source code of the game, you can download and import it on your unity!

2 - The Pacman release vision folder is the build file, you can download it and open the exe file to play the game without downloading the source code!


If you inserting the project into unity hub:
-
 you will notice that there is an empty scene. it is because when you open a project in Unity, Unity has to recreate the Library, the empty default scene gets loaded. Just double click on your Scenes folder and open the saved scene to solve this problem.
